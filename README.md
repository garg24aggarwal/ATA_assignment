There are three notebooks:

langchain_qa.ipynb:********************

***In the above notebook i Have used Langchain ,openAI,Cassandra,VectorStoreIndexWrapper,OpenAIEmbeddings. 
This is the most advanced things I have used to form the question answering method.
 We're combining the forces of Apache Cassandra, DataStax's Astra DB as a vector database, LangChain, Python and the incredible GPT-4 to create a solution****




without_Lanchain.py:**********************
**the code is a text extraction and question-answering script that uses PyMuPDF for PDF processing, regular expressions for text manipulation, and the Hugging Face Transformers library for NLP tasks, specifically leveraging a DistilBERT model fine-tuned for question answering**.
 

simple_method.py:**************************

**this script is a simple yet effective question-answering system using text extraction from PDFs, TF-IDF vectorization for text representation, and cosine similarity for finding the most relevant sentence to a given question.**
