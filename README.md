There are three notebooks:

langchain_qa.ipynb:

In the above notebook i Have used Langchain ,openAI,Cassandra,VectorStoreIndexWrapper,OpenAIEmbeddings. 
This is the most advanced things I have used to form the question answering method.
 We're combining the forces of Apache Cassandra, DataStax's Astra DB as a vector database, LangChain, Python and the incredible GPT-4 to create a solution

without_Lanchain.py:
the code is a text extraction and question-answering script that uses PyMuPDF for PDF processing, regular expressions for text manipulation, and the Hugging Face Transformers library for NLP tasks, specifically leveraging a DistilBERT model fine-tuned for question answering.
